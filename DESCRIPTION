Description: 
  Provides an array of statistical models common in causal inference such as 
  standardization, IP weighting, propensity matching, outcome regression, and doubly-robust 
  estimators. Estimates of the average treatment effects from each model are given with the 
  standard error and a 95% Wald confidence interval (Hernan, Robins (2020) <https://miguelhernan.org/whatifbook/>).
